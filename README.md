# Introduction

This repository contains the code and analysis for Task 2 of my Data Science internship at Prodigy Info Tech. For this task, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of my choice. I chose the Titanic dataset from Kaggle for this analysis.

# Task 2

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis(EDA) on a dataset of your choice,such as the titanic dataset from kaggle.Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

# Analysis Highlights

Conducted data cleaning to handle missing values and duplicates.
Explored relationships between variables such as gender, passenger class, age, fare, and survival rate.
Identified patterns and trends in the data, including the higher survival rate among females, the impact of passenger class on survival, and the relationship between age and survival.
# Conclusion

The data cleaning and exploratory data analysis performed on the Titanic dataset provided valuable insights into the factors influencing survival rates during the Titanic disaster. This analysis contributes to a better understanding of historical events and showcases the application of data science techniques in deriving meaningful insights from data.
